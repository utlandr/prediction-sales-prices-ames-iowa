    "#### Kaggle Overview Summary (from [here][1])\n",
    "This is a data science project that aims to apply the conventional 'Data Science Process' to a dataset. I this case, the dataset consists of 79 explanatory variables detailing resendential homes. Through the data science process, we hope to implement a machine learning algorithm to this dataset to predict the final price of the home.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective** - Predict the final house price of residential properties located in Ames, Iowa.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How will the solution be used?** - To publically display how much I suck at data science to the entire Kaggle community. Accuracy comes in the form of a RMSE between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What the current solutions/workarounds** - See the [submitted kernals][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "**How should this problem be framed?** - Because labels are supplied to us in testing. We will apply a *supervised learning model*.  \n",
